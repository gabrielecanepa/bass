**Bass** is an `HTML`, `CSS` and `Bootstrap` powered web template.

It was realized after completing all the introduction courses on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-blog/assets/logo_blue_dark.png" height="20" alt="Codecademy" title="Codecademy"/></a>

The project was mainly inspired by the courses [HTML & CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web) and [Make a Website](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/make-a-website).
