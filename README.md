**Bass** is an `HTML`, `CSS` and `Bootstrap` powered web template.

It was realized as a free project after completing all the introduction courses on the popular education website   [![Codecademy](img/png/codecademy.png)](https://www.codecademy.com/)

The project was mainly inspired by the courses [HTML & CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web) and [Make a Website](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/make-a-website).
